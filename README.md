 Assets to use in TF2 when streaming

REPLACING MEANS DELETING/MOVING THE OLD FOLDER AND MOVING IN THE NEW FOLDER, NOT OVERWRITING.
Move `custom` to the `tf` folder, overwriting the existing `custom` folder. If you already had mods in there, replace the folder with the new one instead, backup your old `custom` folder if needed.

Replace your `tf/cfg` folder. BACKUP your old cfg folder if you're planning to play TF2 ever again. 
Before launching TF2, disable Steam Cloud Synchronization in the properties of the game in the Steam Library.

Set your launch options for TF2 (same place as Steam Cloud Sync) as these, again, backup your existing launch options if needed:
`-insecure -novid -windowed -noborder -h 1080 -w 1920 -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -precachefontchars -noquicktime -no_texture_stream -console`
