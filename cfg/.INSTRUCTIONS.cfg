//This is a collection of cfgs for casting and demo reviewing based off DumTum's demo review cfg file, and edited by Finn and Starach.
//We are not experts and there are likely better ways to achieve the stuff in here, but this works for us.

//MAKING IT WORK
//To make this work, make sure this is your only active cfg folder in the tf folder (rename your current one something else or move it somewhere else).
//Back up your main cfg and custom folders somewhere else.
//Put '-insecure' into your TF2 launch options. (remove when you want to play the game normally)
//Bear in mind some of the features like projectile outlines will only work for STVs and not normal demos.

//THE FILES
//They are basically the same but tailored to specifically casting or demo reviews.
//For example the casting ones will auto switch to the killers pov, whereas the demo ones will not.
//The current 'autoexec' is technically '_6v6_casting'. It's the one I use the most so it is the current default.
//You can enable the others via console or by changing them to just 'autoexec' (changing the current autoexec to something else of course)
//For the max fps value to change you have to do it while in the main menu not in a demo/STV.
//The four autoexecs and the 'custom_team_names' files are the only custom things in here, everything else is automatically generated.

//NOTES
//Familiarise yourself with the keybindings in the cfgs, there's lots of neat things you can do.
//'custom_team_names' lets you input the teams names beforehand and then use 'c' it to apply them into the hud.
//Many of the key bindings are personal preference, I recommend adapting them to your usage.
//BACK UP YOUR NORMAL CFG
//You might need to put certain commands into your normal cfg to properly reset stuff after swapping back.
//'tf_use_match_hud 1' is a common one, as well as 'cl_crosshair_scale 32' to make your crosshair reappear.
